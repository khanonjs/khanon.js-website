# What do I need to know before starting?

You need to have **basic knowledges** of ***Javascript***, ***Typescript*** and ***npm projects*** before starting a new project.

It is not required to have video games development experience, Khanon.js is here to help you with that in case you are new in it.

In case you need to improve your ***Javascript*** skills, I truly recommend a books series titled 'You don't know JS'.

***Typescript*** documentation can be found [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

As for ***npm projects***, there are plenty of tutorials on the net. Just search some beginners guide, we will use it in a basic way.
