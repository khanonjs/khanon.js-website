# App decorator
The [***App decorator***](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/functions/decorators_app.App.html) is the **main handler** of the application. There's one per project, usually placed in the **app.ts** file in the root of the *src* folder.
The decorated *App class* must **extend** the [*AppInterface*](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/classes/decorators_app.AppInterface.html) to have access to the interface properties and methods.

This **App class** runs the main **lifecycle** of the application. When the web is opened in a browser tab, the App class creates the *Babylon engine* and starts the core handlers. Once everything is loaded and ready to start, it invokes the [***onStart***](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/classes/decorators_app.AppInterface.html#onStart) callback, being this the ***entrypoint*** of the application.

It is possible to create [*App states*](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/modules/decorators_app_app_state.html) to **switch** between different **states of the application**. For example you can create  the *LoadingState* to display a loading screen; once the web is loaded, the game can switch to the *MainMenuState* where the main menu *GUI* (Graphical User Interface) is displayed; if the user press the Play Button, switch to *PlayingGameState*. Each state can be started at any point of the lifecycle and they will configure the *Scene* and *GUI* to run.
