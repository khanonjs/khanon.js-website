# Next steps

At the moment, **Khanon.js is in ALPHA state**. This means there are still missing some features for the BETA state.

To reach the BETA I have to implement these items:

- Input events decorator.

- GUI decorator.

- Sounds and musics module.

- Project builder for debug and production versions.

Once the BETA is stable and the community feedback is good, I will publish the first production verion.

# Future features

Khanon.js plans to integrate more features in the future.

Some things in mind:

- Improve states workflow.

- Improve actors integration in a loaded scene.

- Use of Babylon supported physics engines, generate physical shapes in actors and scenes, add basic physics functionalities.

- Improve the GUI module.

- Adding scene maps for different types of video games (E.g. 3DFPSMap, 2DIsometricMap, 2DVerticalScrollMap, 3DOpenWodlMap, etc)

- Motion module or decorator.

- Support for solid particle system (SPS) and points cloud particle system (PCS).

- Camera system to make smooth transitions.

- Support sockets for online comms.

- Thinking to add more features.. :)
