# Next steps

At the moment, **Khanon.js is in BETA state**. This means we are still testing and finishing the main modules. Once everything is ready we will publish the first production version.

To have the first production version we have to implement these items:

- Input events decorator.

- Improve states workflow.

- Improve actors integration in a loaded scene.

- Sounds and musics module.

- Project builder for debug and production versions.

# Future features

Khanon.js plans to integrate more features in the future.

Some things in mind:

- Use of Babylon supported physics engines, generate physical shapes in actors and scenes, add basic physics functionalities.

- Improve the GUI module.

- Adding scene maps for different types of video games (E.g. 3DFPSMap, 2DIsometricMap, 2DVerticalScrollMap, 3DOpenWodlMap, etc)

- Motion module or decorator.

- Support for solid particle system (SPS) and points cloud particle system (PCS).

- Camera system to make smooth transitions.

- Support sockets for online comms.

- Thinking to add more features.. :)
