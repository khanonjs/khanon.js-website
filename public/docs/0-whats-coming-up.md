# Near future

At the moment, **Khanon.js is in a BETA** state. This means we are still testing it and finishing the main modules. Once everything is ready we will publish the first production version.

To have the **first production** version we still have to implement these items:

&nbsp;
    - ***Mesh*** decorator.

&nbsp;
    - ***GUI*** decorator.

&nbsp;
    - ***SpriteMap*** decorator to build sprite based scenes.

&nbsp;
    - ***MeshMap*** decorator to build mesh based scenes.

&nbsp;
    - Project ***builder*** system (webpack).

&nbsp;
    - ***Debug*** and ***production*** versions.

# Further future

Khanon.js plans to integrate many features in **the future**.

Some things in mind:

&nbsp;
    - Implement a **chainable system to trigger events in actors or scenes** according to other actions like input events, physics events, or whatever (*E.g. actor.triggerer.keyPress('left').callMethod('moveLeft')*)

&nbsp;
    - Support for **solid particle system** (SPS) and **points cloud particle system** (PCS).

&nbsp;
    - Adding more **scene maps for each kind of video game** (*E.g. 3DFPSMap, 2DIsometricMap, 2DVerticalScrollMap, etc*)

&nbsp;
    - Implement a **motion module** to easily move actors in different ways making use of the Babylon physics engine.

&nbsp;
    - Creating a system to easily **generate physical shapes** in actors and scenes using the Babylon physics engine.

&nbsp;
    - Implement **chainable camera system** to make smooth transitions.

&nbsp;
    - Support **sockets** for online comms.

&nbsp;
    - Adding a **CLI tool** to generate and modify projects.

&nbsp;
    - And many more things!
