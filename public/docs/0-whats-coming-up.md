# Near future

At the moment, **Khanon.js is in a BETA** state. This means we are still testing it and finishing the main modules. That's why its current version is lower than 1.
Once everything is ready we will publish the first production version of the engine.

# Further future

Khanon.js plans to integrate many features at some point, after the first production version is released.

Some things we have in mind:

&nbsp;
    - Implement a chainable system to trigger events in actors or scenes according to other actions like input events, physics events, or whatever (*E.g actor.triggerer.keyPress('left').callMethod('moveLeft')*)

&nbsp;
    - Adding different scene maps for each kind of video game (*E.g 3DFPSMap, 2DIsometricMap, 2DVerticalScrollMap, etc*)

&nbsp;
    - Implement a motion module to easily move actors in different ways.

&nbsp;
    - Implement chainable camera system to make smooth transitions between states.

&nbsp;
    - Creating a system to easily generate physical shapes in actors and scenes using the Babylon physics engine.

&nbsp;
    - Imeplement a bundle builder system (Webpack or whatever).

&nbsp;
    - Adding support by CLI to generate, modify and deploy projects.

&nbsp;
    - And many more things!
