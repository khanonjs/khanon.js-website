# Near future

At the moment, **Khanon.js is in a BETA state**. This means we are still testing it and finishing the main modules. Once everything is ready we will publish the first production version.

To have the first production version we still have to implement these items:

&nbsp;
    - Support for input events.

&nbsp;
    - Support for sounds system.

&nbsp;
    - Project builder system (debug and production versions).

# Further future

Khanon.js plans to integrate more features in the future.

Some things in mind:

&nbsp;
    - Implement a chainable system to trigger events in actors or scenes according to other actions like input events, physics events, or whatever (E.g. actor.triggerer.keyPress('left').callMethod('moveLeft'))

&nbsp;
    - Creating a system to easily generate physical shapes in actors and scenes using the Babylon physics engine.

&nbsp;
    - Implement a motion module to easily move actors in different ways making use of the Babylon physics engine.

&nbsp;
    - Adding scene maps for different types of video games (E.g. 3DFPSMap, 2DIsometricMap, 2DVerticalScrollMap, 3DOpenWodlMap, etc)

&nbsp;
    - Support for solid particle system (SPS) and points cloud particle system (PCS).

&nbsp;
    - Implement a chainable camera system to make smooth transitions.

&nbsp;
    - Support sockets for online comms.

&nbsp;
    - Adding a CLI tool to generate and modify projects.

&nbsp;
    - Thinking in more improvements.. :)
