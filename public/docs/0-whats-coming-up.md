# Next steps

At the moment **Khanon.js is in ALPHA stage**, which means there are still a few features missing to have a full BETA.

Features to have a full BETA:

- Input events decorator.

- Sounds and music module.

- Project builder for debug and production optimized bundles.

Once the BETA is stable and the community feedback is good enough, the first production version will be released.

# Future features

Khanon.js plans to integrate more features in the future:

- Improve states workflow.

- Improve actors integration in loaded scenes from url.

- Use of Babylon supported physics engines, generate physical shapes in actors and scenes, add basic physics functionalities.

- Improve the GUI module.

- Adding scene maps for different types of video games (E.g. 3DFPSMap, 2DIsometricMap, 2DVerticalScrollMap, 3DOpenWodlMap, etc)

- Motion module or decorator.

- Support for solid particle system (SPS) and points cloud particle system (PCS).

- Camera system to make smooth transitions.
