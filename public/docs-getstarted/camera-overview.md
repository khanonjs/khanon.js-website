# Camera overview

A camera in a video game is the point of view from where the user watch the action. There are many different types of cameras: top-down, isometric, frist person, third person, etc. Babylon.js provides a wide range of camera types and configuration parameters that you can explore in this [link](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/cameras). [Khanon.js Camera](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/modules/decorators_camera.html) is a wrapper of a [Babylon camera](https://doc.babylonjs.com/typedoc/classes/BABYLON.Camera) object, providing lifecycle and bringing the possibility to modify camera parameters frame by frame thanks to the [onLoopUpdate](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/classes/decorators_camera.CameraInterface.html#onLoopUpdate) method.

Any scene or state may switch of camera at any point depending on the game state requirements.
