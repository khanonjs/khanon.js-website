# Global methods

The [KJS](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/modules/kjs.KJS.html) object has some useful methods to perform global actions:

-  [KJS.throw](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/functions/kjs.KJS.throw.html) stops the app and throws an error. Call it after a critical error that doesn't let the app to continue.

-  [KJS.getApp](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/functions/kjs.KJS.getApp.html) gets the app instance.

-  [KJS.switchAppState](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/functions/kjs.KJS.switchAppState.html) switchs to a new app state.
