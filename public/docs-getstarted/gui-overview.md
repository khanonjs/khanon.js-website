# Graphical User Interface overview

Khanon.js integrates the GUI (Graphical User Interface) in the [scene props](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/interfaces/decorators_scene.SceneProps.html#guis). Once a scene is started, the GUI's associated to it will be displayed.

The GUI used at the moment is the Babylon.js integrated one, but there's plan to switch it to a different GUI more dynamic, with sprites, meshes, particles and animations. Khanon.js provides a [GUI decorator](https://khanonjs.com/api-docs/modules/decorators_gui.html) to compose your scene's GUI in an easy way.

For now, read this [Babylon's section](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/gui/gui) to see how a GUI is composed if you plan to integrate it in your scene.
